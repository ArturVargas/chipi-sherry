[Solved in this commit updating the nextjs config file](https://github.com/ArturVargas/chipi-sherry/commit/719493caaef4c03151f9b2ef5ffbbc7583b7527b)

If My Wallet was in another chain different that the metadata config is, the app is still make the transaction and send in the current chain that I'm using on my wallet and not in the config chain on the app

The Tx Hash show in the sherry app is redirect to the avalanche fuji explorer, ignoring the chain id that I configure on my app (Celo Alfajores)

I couldn't find how to serialize 2 transactions as an array, I was trying to send approve and recharge transaction but I get an error

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
